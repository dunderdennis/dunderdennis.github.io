I grew up in Algutsrum on Ã–land. A wonderful place to grow up with incredibly beautiful nature, which one took for granted at a younger age. Unfortunately, it's not the world's most lively place for a dude in his twenties and I have basically lived in Kalmar since I was 18. (A one-year stint in Karlskrona as well)

My ambition is to work as a programmer in the IT industry, which never seems to stop developing, which is something very attractive to me.

# Previous experience & education

* 2016-17 - Backpacking - After my above employment, I traveled through Southeast Asia for just over 3 months. I feel like nowadays there are countless places I have on my imaginary "bucket list".
