* **What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?**

    In my opinion pre-compiling CSS has a way higher learning curb than regular CSS, however once you get the hang of it, I'd say it's much easier to work with since you don't have to repeat yourself nearly as much. 
    
    For example, you don't have to type "nav li ul" and similar things for every instance of CSS that you want to change, instead using tabulation to gather all the "nav"-CSS and changing it much more intuitiely. 

    Using variables to define fonts and colors also helps out quite a bit when you want to i.e. change a color, you don't have to find every little instance of the code like in regular CSS.

    Those are some substantial pros for using a pre-compiler. For cons of pre-compiling CSS; as previously mentioned the high learning curb is for sure a con. Also I've found that pre-compiling is much more prone to errors, whereas regular CSS usally just *works* (albeit with eventual errors).

* **What do you think of static site generators?**

    I think they are fantastic for creating a quite stylish and modern website such as a blog instantly. I was surprised when I first got the site running how nice it actually was.

    The drawbacks of SSG in my opinion is that they're harder to configure than a typical website. If you want to change the layout, or some pages you hav to dig for the right place to edit it. Also, getting it running was a huge hassle, while compared to just creating a index.html and opening it in your browser.

* **What type of projects are they suitable for?**

    I would say it is suitable for people or companies who are not familiar with web design to quickly get started with, for example, a blog. The .markdown syntax is tremendously intuitive and easy to work in. I have to say, it really makes typing for HTML super easy.

* **What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?**

    Robots.txt is a file which is used to instruct visiting web robots whether they should or should not visit pages on the site (and which pages).

    For this site, I have configured it to allow web robots from Google, but it disallows all other web robits.

* **What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?**

    Humans.txt is a text file which contains information about the people who have worked on the website.

    I have configured it to include my name, my location and some basic contact information of mine. It also includes information about when this site was last updated, and what language it is written in.

* **How did you implement comments to blog posts**

    I used Disqus (as the assignment instructions mentioned) by first registering on their website. I then followed [this guide](https://desiredpersona.com/disqus-comments-jekyll/) which was very intuitive and got me set up rather quickly.

    I did have some issues at first that my comment section didn't connect to the server (can't remember the exact error), this turned out to be a problem with my shortname which was not correct.

* **What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?**

    I'd love to find out =)
